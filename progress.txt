5.10.16

Kleps: I wrote the pretty printer. This found a couple
of parsing bugs, like function calling being dead
and something wrong with parsing returns as well.
Removed the color change code for tests. 
Fixed the test code so that it followed the new file endings
for .spl files.

Algae: Wrote AST equality comparison, used it to finish the parse structure 
test. Added semantics directory which currently holds the beginnings of
scope/type checking and AST transformation (eg for->while)

5.16.16

Algae:
Finished scope/type checking (probably broken, haven't tested manually yet,
much less written tests for the suite).

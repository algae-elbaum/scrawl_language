Week 3: Get parsing done.
        Make good progress on getting to the intermediate code
Week 4: Get the intermediate code down.
        Start on the way to assembly (ch 8, 9 of Tiger)
Week 5: Get closer to assembly (ch 9, 10)
Week 6: Get assembly done (ch 11, 12)
        (Though maybe not for more complicated things like closures)
Week 7: Start optimization (control/data flow analysis... other stuff?)
Week 8: Probably more optimization
        Closures, Anything else that looks fun
Week 9: Playing around with more optimization and features
Week 10: Same as above, but also trying to wrap everything up nicely
Week 11: Finals, probably not doing much for this project. Maybe some
         final touches for the code and documentation
